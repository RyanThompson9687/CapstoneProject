# CapstoneProject

The Florida Polytechnic University Capstone project is a program where senior students work on a project sponsored by an outside company over the course of their senior year.

My group's project was sponsored by the company SkyFi, who tasked us with creating a predictive weather model to determine the liklihood that a satellite image (the image being the product sold by SkyFi) would be clear or cloudy, with clouds ruining a successful image capture.

My contribution to this project was to create a web-based interactive dashboard UI that would allow a user to interact with the model by inputting the necessary information, and recieving the results on the webpage. 

This dashboard UI was written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, built using two 3rd-party open-source tools: LeafletJS (with geocoder extension) and PyScript.

Documentation for these tools can be found here:

PyScript - https://pyscript.net/

LeafletJS - https://leafletjs.com/

Geocoder Extension - https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-control-geocoder
